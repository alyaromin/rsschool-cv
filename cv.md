### About Me
I'm 40 y.o. leading service engineer in company that produces electronic devices. I like my job and I'm good at consideration of complaints, finding malfunctions, defect analysis etc. From time to time I have to automate my routine and learning programming helps me with it.

During my introduction to programming I didn't used it as a professional skill. May be it is because I haven't found what I'm more interested in yet. So, I keep wandering in this ocean, and who knows, may be frontend (or even web at all) is my cup of tea.
