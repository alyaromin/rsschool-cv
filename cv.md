### About Me
I'm 40 y.o. leading service engineer in company that produces electronic devices. I like my job and I'm good at consideration of complaints, finding malfunctions, defect analysis etc.

From time to time I try to automate my routine and learning programming helps me with it. I'm inspired with programming as a huge abstract field for creating things working in real life. But I've never used it as a professional skill.

May be it is because I haven't found what I'm more interested in yet. So, I keep wandering in this ocean, and who knows, may be frontend (or even web at all) is my cup of tea.
